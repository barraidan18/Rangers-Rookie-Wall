Start by importing all the relevant data into SQL tables. It is possible to import the data directly into R but having the data an SQL database is useful.

Here is the R code to make the conection to the PosgreSQL database, query it and then analyze the data. I have replaced the user name and password for the database that I used with "yourpassword" and "yourusername" so that strangers can't access my database.
